Some of the advantages:

  * Domain-specific languages allow solutions to be expressed in the idiom and at the level of abstraction of the problem domain. Consequently, domain experts themselves can understand, validate, modify, and often even develop domain-specific language programs.
  * Self-documenting code.
  * Domain-specific languages enhance quality, productivity, reliability,[maintainability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maintainability),[portability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portability_(computer_science))and[reusability](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reusability).
  * Domain-specific languages allow[validation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_security)at the domain level. As long as the language constructs are safe any sentence written with them can be considered safe.

Some of the disadvantages:

  * Cost of learning a new language vs. its limited applicability
  * Cost of designing, implementing, and maintaining a domain-specific language as well as the tools required to develop with it ([IDE](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Development_Environment))
  * Finding, setting, and maintaining proper scope.
  * Difficulty of balancing trade-offs between domain-specificity and general-purpose programming language constructs.
  * Potential loss of processor[efficiency](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_efficiency)compared with hand-coded software.
  * Proliferation of similar non-standard domain specific languages, i.e. a DSL used within insurance company A versus a DSL used within insurance company B.

  

DSL을 하면서 느꼈던 고민들이 위키피디아에 잘 나와 있었다.

내가 큰 단점으로 느꼈던 것들을 빨갛게 칠해보았다.
